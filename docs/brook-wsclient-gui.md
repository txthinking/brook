## Tips

* On desktop, please prefer to use Chrome browser. You may need to restart your browser or application
* If you choose `proxy` mode on the GUI client, some software requires manual config proxy:
    - [**Telegram**] Settings->Data and Storage->Use Proxy->Add Proxy->Socks5, Server: `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, Port: `1080` -> Done. **Restart Telegram, it has a bug on this**
